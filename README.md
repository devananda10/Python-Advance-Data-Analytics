Title: Banking Customer Registration Management System Using Python
1️⃣ Introduction

Customer registration is the first and most important process in banking systems. Proper storage and management of customer details ensures security, compliance, and efficient service delivery.

This project proposes a Customer Registration Management System developed using Python object-oriented programming concepts.

The system will register, store, and process customer details using:

Classes

Inheritance

Dictionaries

Loops

File parsing

2️⃣ Problem Statement

Manual customer registration may lead to:

Data duplication

Human errors

Poor data management

Difficulty in retrieving records

An automated system is required to:

Register customers securely

Store customer details efficiently

Retrieve and validate data

3️⃣ Objectives

To design a structured customer registration module

To store customer details using dictionary

To implement OOP concepts like inheritance

To parse customer details from files

To process multiple customers using loops
